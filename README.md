# ECE244 vs ECE244-PUBLIC

This repository is basically identical to my other ece244-public repo, but with a few differences:
- This repo contains the issues I pushed and incorporated into my workflow for the lab assignments
- This repo also contains code I wrote for questions from past ECE 244 exams

Hopefully you can find some use out of this repository. As always, please don't plagiarise any work from this repo. The code is far from perfect and so copying the imperfections will almost certainly result in an AO.
